<strong>Task 1 - Apple mobility data</strong>

Get data from there:

https://covid19.apple.com/mobility

 

The function will take no argument but need to return a Pandas dataframe with the following columns :

geo_type, region, transportation_type, alternative_name, sub-region, country, date, value

<strong>Task 2 - FSA data </strong>


https://www.fsa.usda.gov/news-room/efoia/electronic-reading-room/frequently-requested-information/crop-acreage-data/index
 
The function will take a list of years as argument.

For each year, the data should be extracted from the website. More specifically, the “county_data” sheet will be the one we are interested in.

The publication date is important and need to be added to each dataframe.
